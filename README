= Ruby Hooks

This library adds support for chained before, after, and around method
callbacks to Ruby.

== Installation

== Installing the gem

To install this library as a gem, do:

    $ sudo gem install ruby-hooks

== Installing as a Rails plugin

If you are installing this as a plugin for your Rails application, do this
from your application root:

    $ script/plugin install git://github.com/kristinalim/ruby-hooks

== Usage

To add filters, simply set up the class for hooks by calling :uses_hooks, and
the call the append_to_before_callbacks and append_to_after_callbacks methods
from your class.

    class HookTest
      def self.main_method
        puts '-- main method' ; return "RETURN VALUE"
      end
  
      def self.after_method
        puts '-- after callback'
      end

      def self.before_method
        puts '-- before callback'
      end

      uses_hooks
      append_to_before_callbacks :before_method, :main_method
      append_to_after_callbacks :after_method, :main_method
    end

    # >> HookTest.main_method
    # -- before callback
    # -- main method
    # -- after callback
    # => "RETURN VALUE"

Note that it is still the return value of the primary non-hook method that is
returned.

== To Do

* Around filters are not yet supported.
* This is not yet tested for modules.
* This library is not safe for multi-threaded applications.
